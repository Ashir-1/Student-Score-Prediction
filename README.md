Data preprocessing and visualization

Multiple regression models for prediction

Comparison of models with evaluation metrics

Experiments with feature combinations (e.g., sleep, participation)

Polynomial regression implementation

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

📊 Results

Polynomial regression improved performance compared to linear regression.

Feature selection significantly affected accuracy.

Visualizations show correlations between study habits and scores.
